# Zillow_Home_Value


This repository contains script which I wrote to participate in Zillow's Home Value Kaggle Competition.< br/>

This R script (zill_v1.R) contain functions which do the following:< br/>
   * In a categorical variable, match the levels in train and test data
   * In a categorical variable, encode the levels which are below a certain frequency.
   * Label Encoding

I plan to add more scripts in this repository so that others can get ideas from it.
